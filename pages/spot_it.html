        <h1>Generating "Spot It!" Cards</h1>
        <p>Spot it is a game where you try to quickly find the picture shared between your card and other card.
        The surprising aspect of the game is that any two cards share exactly one picture. 
        How can this be done? In this page, I describe an algorithm that takes a set of symbols and returns a set of cards that matches
        our description.
